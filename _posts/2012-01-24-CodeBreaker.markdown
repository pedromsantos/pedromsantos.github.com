<p>
	When I started learning Objective-C I found out about <a href="http://nscodernight.com/">NSCoder Nights</a> and discovered that Barcelona had also a <a href="http://nscoders.org/">NSCoder Night</a>. I joined up and discovered a great comunity of Objective-C developers. I try to contribute as much as I can to software develoment comunities. So as soon has I had my act togheter on the language I decided it was my turn to give back to the community. I offerd as a voluntear to speak at some events. The last one was a few month ago and I talked about Behaviour Driven Develoment in Objective-C. I tryed to explain how we could use Cucumber in our projects and what I had done to embrace BDD. To support this talk I ported the initial chapters of the excelent RSpec book to Objective-C. You can find the code on my GitHub <a href="https://github.com/pedromsantos/CodeBreaker">here</a>.
