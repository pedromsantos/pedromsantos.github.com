<p>
	While learning BDD for iOS using the <a href="https://github.com/allending/Kiwi">Kiwi</a> framework I experimented a few coding katas using Objective-C and this framework. Coding katas are a great way, for me, to learn new languages or frameworks. Their scope is restricted and focused on using programming best practices. I've now switched all my tests from Apple's framework to Kiwi with great results. In my GitHub you can find the FizzBuzz kata code. If you are new to Kiwi take a look at the code. <a href="https://github.com/pedromsantos/FizzBuzz">FizzBuzz code on GitHub</a> I've also uploaded a video to vimeo where I live code this kata in Objective-C and XCode 4 the video is <a href="http://vimeo.com/27073092">here</a>.
