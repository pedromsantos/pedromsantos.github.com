<p>First day impressions 27 Feb</p>

<p>Registration</p>
<p>I always expect registration in big events to be a bit painful, surprisingly registration to the MWC2012 went super smooth. First kudos for the organization..</p>

<p>Where's my session?</p>
<p>Once inside I asked for directions to the Intel conference I had registered. At the information desk they had no knowledge of such event. Fortunately I was able to find the registration confirmation email with the coordinates to the event. Unfortunately information was not able to direct me to the conference even with the coordinates I had. They had also run out of maps to the congress. The maximum they could do was to tell me the general direction to hall 7. After asking around I was able to get to the correct hall. Next struggle, finding room A. Nobody seamed to know where room A was. After wandering around on the hall I ended up next to the kitchen entrance. Surprisingly a cook was able to tell me where room A was. Unsurprisingly as I was entering room A the doors opened to mark the end of the session. Fail.</p>
