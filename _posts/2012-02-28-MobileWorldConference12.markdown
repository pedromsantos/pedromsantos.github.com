<p>First day impressions 27 Feb</p>

<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>I allways expect registration in big events to be a bit painfull,
suprinsigly registration to the MWC2012 went super smooth. First kudos
for the organization.</p>

<h3>Where's my session?</h3>
<p>Once inside I asked for directions to the Intel conference I had
registered. At the information desk they had no knowledge of such event.
Fortunatly I was able to find the registration
confirmation email with the coordinates to the event. Unfortunatly
information was not able to direct me to the conference even with the coordinates I
had. They had also run out of maps to the congress. The maximum they
could do was to tell me the general direction to hall 7. After asking
around I was able to get to the correct hall. Next struggle, finding
room A. Nobody seamed to know where room A was. After wnandering
around on the hall I ended up next to the kitchesn entrance.
Supprisingly a cook was able to tell me where room A was. Unsupprisigly
as I was entering room A the doors opened to mark the end of the
session. Fail.</p>
