	Regarding code, this version brings big refractors. We took the opportunity to clean up the code base and make the design more explicit. There is still a design decision that I'm struggling with. Should the domain model notify model changes using notifications or delegate callbacks? We are still using delegate call backs although we simplified a lot the call back mechanisms in place. I understand that using notifications brings greater decoupling between the domain model and the controllers. The problem for me, until now, has been how to implement unit testing over notifications. I need to investigate how to unit test a project using notifications more deeply before committing to a decision. If you have experience in this area I'd appreciate a comment.
