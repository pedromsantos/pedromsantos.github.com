#DCPU16.Net and ObjC-DCPU-16-ASM

[DCPU16.Net](https://github.com/pedromsantos/DCPU16.Net) is a software implementation of DCPU16 according to the specs @notch published [here](http://0x10c.com/doc/dcpu-16.txt) in C#.

[ObjC-DCPU-16-ASM](https://github.com/pedromsantos/ObjC-DCPU-16-ASM) also implements DCPU16 according to the same specs but instead of using C# using Objective-C and CocoaTouch. 

It has been great fun and a great learning experience implementing an assembler and emulator from scratch.

The Objcetive-C implementations is a bit more mature regarding end to end functionality. It even has a barely functional UI. Regarding code, the C# implementation is much more mature, I was able to implement it using a much pure OO approach. 

It was a chalanging implementing the project using OO since in all my previous implementations of Lexers and Parsers I had done, used a procedural aproach. Also most of the implementations for DCPU16 I found, where using mostly a procedural aproach, even the ones implemented using OO languages.
